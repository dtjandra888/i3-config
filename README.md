# i3 Config
This repos includes my i3 configuration file for my personal system. I'm currently running a minimal debian setup with i3 and no DE.

## Changes from Default 
- Rebound directions to hjkl
- Autostarts picom
- Autostarts nitrogen
- Set default terminal to kitty
- Using lightdm lock instead of i3lock
- Using polybar instead of i3status
- Using rofi instead of dmenu

# TODO:
- Configure polybar
- Configure rofi
    - Lots of preconfigured ones on github. Some require dependencies you don't want to install
- Configure windows
    - Make corners rounded?
    - remove top window bar?
- Change font?
